# C-Mate
A Sublime Text 3 package to help you write C code more efficiently.

# Why C-Mate ?
C-Mate becomes special when it comes to build and run code in sublime. It consists of a build system which is capable of running code in new terminal.

It comes with pre-coded functions which noone wants to write again and again like swap function. 

Useful shortcuts like for loop, while loop and typedef are also incorporated in this package.

#How to get C-Mate ?
Until it gets avaiable through sublime package manager, you'll have to install it manually. But its just a 2 step process.
